# chainlink

This repository contains some simple scripts to generate traffic to your ChainLink Oracle.

## Prerequisites

Follow the guide in https://docs.chain.link/docs/example-walkthrough. The scripts depend on you using the private key of an account so create a new metamask account first with a fresh seedphrase you don't need anymore. If you don't want to use metamask but truffle or something else to deploy your contracts you can just get LINK here https://docs.chain.link/docs/acquire-link

Follow the instructions https://docs.chain.link/docs/running-a-chainlink-node and https://docs.chain.link/docs/fulfilling-requests to manually check your setup.

## Using the scripts

During the instructions you created two contracts: An Oracle contract and a TestnetConsumer contract.
